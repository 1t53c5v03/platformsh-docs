  By default, a Platform.sh app is available at a domain generated by Platform.sh. The following resources help you take your application live on your custom domain.

{{% description %}}

This page gives a basic configuration example.
For more details, see the [Step by step guide](../domains/steps/_index.md).

## Before you begin

You need to:

- Have a project that's ready to be live.
- Have a project plan size that's set to **Standard** or higher.
- Have a domain and have access to its settings on the registrar's website.
- (Optional) Have the [CLI](../development/cli/_index.md) installed locally.
- Make sure that your registrar allows [CNAMEs on Apex domains or one of the alternatives](/domains/steps/dns.md).

## 1. Configure your DNS provider

To configure your domain name to point to your project:

1. Log-in to your registrar's website to manage your domain.
2. Set the Time-To-Live (TTL) on your domain to the lowest possible value to minimize transition time.

3. Get the CNAME target by running the [CLI](../development/cli/_index.md) command `platform environment:info edge_hostname`.

3. Get the CNAME target by accessing your production environment and copy the automatically generated URL you use to access your website.
  For e.g. if the url to access your production environment is `https://main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`, the CNAME target is `main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`.

4. Add a CNAME record from the `www` subdomain (`www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`) to the value of the CNAME target.
5. Add a CNAME/ANAME/ALIAS from your apex domain (`<YOUR_DOMAIN>`) to the value of the CNAME target.
  Not all registrar allow these kind of records, see additional information about [Apex domains and CNAME records](/domains/steps/dns.md).
6. Check that the domain and subdomain are working as expected.
7. Set the TTL value back to its previous value.

Note that depending on your registrar and the TTL you set on step 2,
it can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 72 hours for the DNS change to fully propagate across the Internet.

## 2. Set your domain

Note: custom domains can only be added to the default environment on production plans (Standard or larger).
Also, adding a custom domain disables the automatically generated URLs (`main-def456-abc123.eu-2.platformsh.site`).

Add a single domain to your Platform.sh project for `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`:

{{< codetabs >}}

title=In the console
file=none

<!--This is in HTML to get the icon not to break the list. -->
<ol>
  <li>Select the project where you want to add a domain.</li>
  <li>Click {{< icon settings >}} <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</code> into the <strong>Domain</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>+ Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>

Run the following command:

```bash
platform domain:add -p <PROJECT_ID> <YOUR_DOMAIN>
```

If you are planning on using subdomains across multiple projects, [the setup differs slightly](./steps/subdomains.md).
