api: |
  Everything you use to interact with your projects and environments is built on top of the Platform.sh API. 
  You can place requests directly against `https://api.platform.sh/` once you have [authenticated with an OAuth2 token](https://api.platform.sh/docs/#section/Authentication).
  <br/><br/>
  Consult the [API documentation](https://api.platform.sh/docs/) and the [OpenAPI specification](https://api.platform.sh/docs/openapispec-platformsh.json) for more details.
blackfire: |
  [Blackfire.io](https://blackfire.io/docs) is a code performance observability solution, and a part of Platform.sh since 2021.
  It is composed of a profiling, application performance monitoring, and performance testing toolset that enables you to develop a 
  comprehensive continuous observability strategy for your applications.
  <br/><br/>
  Existing Blackfire accounts can be configured any Professional or Dedicated project on Platform.sh, or it can be added to any project in our Elite and Enterprise tiers. 
  See our [documentation](/integrations/observability/blackfire.md) for details on getting started, and the [Blackfire documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/introduction) 
  for a more comprehensive introduction.

  [machine users](/development/cli/api-tokens.md#create-a-machine-user) or to [run within your environments](/development/cli/api-tokens.md#on-a-platformsh-environment).

console: |
  Platform.sh provides a repsonsible management console which allows you to interact with your projects and manage your environments.
  You can access the management console at [`console.platform.sh`](https://console.platform.sh).
  Consult the [documentation](/administration/web.html) for more details.
services: |
  You are able to add a number of [built-in services](/configuration/services.html) to your projects with minimal configuration. 
  Services on Platform.sh are considered "managed", in that you have the ability to commit specific minor versions in most cases, while patch versions and security fixes are updated
  automatically by Platform.sh between deployments as they become available. 
blog: |
  The Platform.sh Blog contains the latest updates around major news, product announcements, case studies, and interesting experiments we've found internally working with Platform.sh. 
  You can find the blog [on our website](https://platform.sh/blog/), and you can subscribe to updates by [joining our newsletter](https://platform.sh/preferences/).

templates: |
